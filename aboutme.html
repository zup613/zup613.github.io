            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! Ryan Kim here and I'm currently 14 years old attending to Math And Science College Prepatory highschool and I am a freshmen. I love P.E the best throughout all the subjects and I play for the Varsity Volleyball team! I didnt think I would have made it without my cousin Jonny. But my goal is to become a professional Volleyball player and I'm going to attend to try to get into UC Berkley. I hope I can also become an Aerospace Engineer if I cant get into sports. Thats why I'm taking the computer science class. If I do get into an aerospace engineering college, I will work hard and try to get into NASA and help the first man get to Pluto! Its going to be a very long project but I believe that we will do it in the future.</p>
            <h2>Aerospace Engineer</h2>
            <br/><p>My goal is to be an aerospace engineer one day. Out of all the jobs, why aerospace engineering? I want to be the one that makes the first space shuttle that makes it to mars. This is my ultimate goal because I think one day, Earth isn’t going to be livable because of the things we’re doing. Polluting the world, wars, and other dumb reasons. So eventually our only option might be going to the moon or mars.

In middle school, we had a project where we had to make a rocket that had to go a certain height and land it safely. My group was stressed out because we had no idea where to get the firepower. We tried 10 fireworks together, but the rocket was to heavy. We tried making the rocket lighter but the rocket wouldn’t have enough weight to balance. It was like a plane flying with one wing. But at the end, we came up with a solution. We were just overthinking it, as long as it reached the height, we would’ve been good so we decided to tie only 3 fireworks with our light rocket and we had a plastic bag on the top so when it fell, it would land safely. So at the end we got the A and were happy.  So during this activity, this achievement allowed my group and I to learned that being patient can also give us the solution. This is when I found out that I have some abilities in this area and what made me want to be an aerospace engineer.  

So at the end, my goal on being an aerospace engineer will be absolute and I’ll always remember my biggest achievement from middle school. I’ll also try to make another achievement in high school by making a better and stronger rocket from middle school.
